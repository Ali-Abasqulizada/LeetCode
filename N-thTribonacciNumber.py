'''
The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows: 

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.

Given n, return the value of Tn.
'''

class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, middle, right = 0, 1, 1
        for _ in range(n):
            left, middle, right = middle, right, left + middle + right
        return left

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

Example 2:

Input: n = 25
Output: 1389537
