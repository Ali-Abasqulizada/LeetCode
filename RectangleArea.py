'''
Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).

The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).

class Solution:
    def computeArea(self, ax1: int, ay1: int, ax2: int, ay2: int, bx1: int, by1: int, bx2: int, by2: int) -> int:
        a_area = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1)
        b_area = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1)
        c_x = min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1)
        c_y = min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1)
        c_area = c_x * c_y
        if c_x < 0 or c_y < 0:
            c_area = 0
        return a_area + b_area - c_area
